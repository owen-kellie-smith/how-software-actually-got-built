# how-software-actually-gets-built

A lightweight visual model of how software is actually built in practice,
focusing on what development artifacts exist and where they actually live.

This repository contains two conceptual diagrams:

- **Development cycle** — how key artifacts are created, selected, and used
- **Where development artifacts actually live** — where those artifacts end up in real organisations

The diagrams are descriptive rather than prescriptive.
They reflect common trade-offs and constraints observed in day-to-day software development,
rather than an idealised process.

Deliberately omitted: formal project plans and decision records, which
in practice tend to be transient, fragmented across tools,
or embedded implicitly in tickets, code, and everyday conversations.
