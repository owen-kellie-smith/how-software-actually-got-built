# how-software-actually-gets-built

A lightweight visual model of how software is actually built in practice —
showing how development artifacts are created, selected, stored, approximated,
and sometimes discarded.

This repository contains two conceptual diagrams:

- **Development cycle** — who creates what, and why
- **Where development artifacts actually live** — where those artifacts end up in real organisations

Deliberately omitted: formal project plans and decision records, which in practice tend to be transient, fragmented across tools,
or embedded implicitly in tickets, code, and day-to-day conversations.
